            <h1><b>here are a few programs i have created</b></h1>
            <p>first, a poor attempt at a neural network that i created for my final project in freshman year.
                in running this program, a hundred neural nets are created, each with one hundred layers each having
                one hundred nodes, and this massive network is trained to do basic addition. traditional weights and biases
                were not used, and rather a system in which each node outputted a certain number and required a certain total inputs
                to output that value to all the nodes ahead that which it was connected to. It performs about as well as you would think.
            </p>

            <p>next up is a program i am particularly proud of, the program in question being a bullet hell style game in which
                you must try to avoid getting hit for as long as possible as the game cycles between three different "phases", all
                with different bullet patterns and shapes.

            <p>
                finally, a program that i made a long time ago, that generates any requested amount of prime numbers sequentially.
